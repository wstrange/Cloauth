A sample OAuth2 provider written in Clojure. 

I created this as a learning vehicle to teach myself about OAuth and Clojure and Noir. 

I found there were plenty of sample OAuth clients around, but few OAuth providers. 

No claims are made about this being OAuth2 compliant! (it probably isn't!). This is mostly patterned
after the google documentation at http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/OAuth2.html. I found the 
google docs easier reading than the OAuth spec (YMMV).


The application is deployed to heroku. You can try it out at http://cloauth.herokuapp.com
