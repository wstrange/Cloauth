A sample OAuth2 provider written in Clojure. 

I created this as a learning vehicle to teach myself about OAuth and Clojure and Noir. 

I found there were plenty of OAuth clients around, but few examples of a OAuth providers. 

No claims are made about this being OAuth2 compliant! (it probably isn't!). 

The application may be running on heroku. You can try it out at http://cloauth.herokuapp.com
