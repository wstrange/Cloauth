Auth Filters:
    Figure out how to implement filters for authentication
    
    - Public
    - User based  - session 
    - client id/ secret 

Token Expiry 
    Expire code / access tokens
    
    
    
client - redirectUri - could be a collection
 
 If a user has previously authorized a client, should we not prompt for authentication again?
